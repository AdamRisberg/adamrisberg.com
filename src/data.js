  "I started my adventures in web development making simple, static websites in Dreamweaver for a few people here and there. I didn’t even know how to write the code, I just relied on the software. I was always interested in programming, but web development seemed like more of a design field. I was wrong, of course, but regardless, I ended up setting the web aside and started learning C# for software development.",
  "Shortly after that, a company that I had worked for in the past found out I was getting into programming and asked if I could make them business software to replace their old, obsolete DOS programs. Orders, accounting, payroll, etc. I knew it was going to be a massive undertaking, and a lot to learn, but I took on the challenge. After way too many sleepless nights, the project was a success, and ended up being the first of many projects for that company.",
  "Eventually, I was hired to create another website. This time, more complex than anything I had created in the past. I decided it was time to drop Dreamweaver and finally start learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Which changed everything. As I learned more and more, I started discovering things like React, Node.js, Express, etc. I quickly fell in love with the complexity, fast pace, and seemingly limitless possibilities that I didn’t know existed in web development. There’s always something new to learn.",
  "With my interest now peaked, I continued taking every course I could find online, working through tutorials, watching conferences, etc. It quickly became my primary focus and passion, where I continue learning every day and seeking out new challenges."
